                    I joined Embark to enhance code quality through best practices
                    and introducing automated testing. The role evolved into a
                    Tech Lead position, overseeing day-to-day operations for
                    projects on the marketing site and the store.

                    conversion rate optimizations were constant focuses.

                <p>
                    Working as the Senior Developer at WP White Security, I
                    focused on rewriting and supporting the flagship plugins from
                    the company. Reducing technical complexity while building new
                    features. I also helped hire a new Junior Developer and
                    trained them to take over developer responsibilities on several
                    of the plugins.
                </p>

                <h4>Key responsibilities</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Handling all engineering decisions for the company

                        tasks, guiding them as needed and helping them grow into
                        a more senior role.

                    10up operates at a rapid pace, assigning each engineer to
                    multiple projects simultaneously. This approach grants
                    engineers the autonomy to decide when and how to focus on
                    their tasks, aligning with project manager priorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I contributed to impactful projects here, such as
                    optimizing the Nobel Prize website for scalability and
                    performance. Also worked on an early stage AI project for
                    writing assistance, powered by IBM Watson.

                    Freelancing allowed me to work on varied and interesting
                    projects. A large amount of the projects have been WordPress
                    based, but I have also worked on Shopify and other custom
                    CMS projects.
